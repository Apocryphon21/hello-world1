# hello-world1
I am trying to learn git again and this time im not gonna stop or take a break

My target is to make super fun games that the players will enjoy alot.
But i will devote only 6month for this if i am not able to progress in this field i will move on from game development and try something else!
Cause i want explore where my true potential lies!!
